=======

This is my attempt at an efficient time and memory hard key stretching algorithm based on
scrypt.  Various members of the community at password-hashing.net have contributed so
generously to NoelKDF, that it is hard to claim as my own.

Please read NoelKDF.odt for a description of the algorithm and credits for ideas
contributed.

I, Bill Cox, place this code into the public domain.  There are no hidden back-doors or
intentional weaknesses, and I blieve it violates no patents.  I will file no patents on
any material in this project.  I have included sha.c and sha.h which I copied from the
scrypt project, and which is available through the BSD license.

TODO
