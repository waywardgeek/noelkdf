This is some code designed to pebble graphs somewhat efficiently.  This can provide a
lower bound on the effectiveness of TMTO attacks.

The first version will place N pebbles, and put them in a "lazy group".  A pebble can be
pulled from the lazy group without specifying which one, but we decrement the number of
pebbles available in the group when we do.  We also can remove a pebble from the group at
any time, which we do if we have a dependency on it while pebbling another node.  Once the
group's available pebble counter reaches 0, we remove all the pebbles remaining in the
group and build a new group from all the pebbles currently placed.

This will always pebble 2N nodes without recalculation.

Example usage:

predict> ./pebble -m 1024 -p 128 -s 12 catena3
========= Testing catena3
Total pebbles: 128 out of 1024 (12.5%)
Recalculation penalty is 179.6943X
Mid-cut size: 256 (25.0%)
